<h1>eCDP</h1>
<br>
<h2>This game was never released to the public in any form but the game was confirmed to be in the hands of a person named Coddy Trentuit who refused to share the game's files due to legal reasons and the game was considered lost media until November 17, 2020 (11/17/2020) when a Youtuber named Nick Robinson published a video titled "The 10-Year Hunt for the Lost McDonald's DS Game" (which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/-e6xOBCAVvA">here</a>) where he went over the history of the lost game and then revealed how he got his hands on it. Afterwards he published a full play through of the game (which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/KJTZsL_UYwA">here</a>) and also dumped the game's rom to allow everyone to enjoy & preserve the game. It is known that 3700 stores used eCDP/eSmart with each store beiong equipped with 2 DS systems to use for training purposes and the eCDP/eSmart program started in 2009 and seems to have ended in about 2015</h2>
