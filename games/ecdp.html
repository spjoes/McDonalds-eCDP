<h2>This game was never released to the public in any form but the game was confirmed to be in the hands of a person named Coddy Trentuit who refused to share the game's files due to legal reasons and the game was considered lost media until November 17, 2020 (11/17/2020) when a Youtuber named Nick Robinson published a video titled "The 10-Year Hunt for the Lost McDonald's DS Game" (which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/-e6xOBCAVvA">here</a>) where he went over the history of the lost game and then revealed how he got his hands on it. Afterwards he published a full play through of the game (which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/KJTZsL_UYwA">here</a>) and also dumped the game's rom to allow everyone to enjoy & preserve the game. It is known that 3700 stores used eCDP/eSmart with each store beiong equipped with 2 DS systems to use for training purposes and the eCDP/eSmart program started in 2009 and seems to have ended in about 2015. Both eSmart and eCDP had an estimated budget of about 200 million yen which is about 2.2mil USD</h2>

<h2>eCDP also has an online leadrboard which is now accessible through the Wiimmfi program. Currently as of writing (December 20th, 2020) a user under the name of "GYROJM" holds the 1st place spot with 3200 points. The identity of the user is still unknown.</h2>
