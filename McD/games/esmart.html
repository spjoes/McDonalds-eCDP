  <h1>eSmart/2.0</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Not much is known about this game but it seems to be a version of the eCDP game. eSmart seems to have been created before eCDP and was used to train workers that were already working at McDonalds and therefore was more challenging than eCDP. It is known that 3700 stores used eSmart/eCDP with each store beiong equipped with 2 DS systems to use for training purposes and the eSmart/eCDP program started in 2009 and seems to have ended in about 2015. Both eSmart and eCDP had an estimated budget of about 200 million yen which is about 2.2mil USD</h2>
  <h2>So far there are 2 known versions of eSmart (eSmart & eSmart 2.0). There were known auctions on this game but the outcomes are still unknown. On 12/4/2020 there was one known person that was believed to be in possesion of an eSmart cartridge, it was later figured out that this person only owns things such as box, manual, etc. for the game. But does not own the actual cartridge.</h2>
  <h2>No more info was found related to the eSmart games until 1 year later on 11/06/2021 (November 6th, 2021) when the eSmart 2.0 game, box, and manual were listed on Yahoo auctions for 100,000 yen (~$877 USD as of November 14th, 2021) (the listing can be found <a href="https://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/g1017732021">here</a>). The listing ended within a minute of being posted and the outcome was unknown for 8 days until a post was made on twitter from the buyer (@XX_750000) of the auction. (which can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/XX_750000/status/1459747944513425413">here</a>). The tweet showcased the cartridge, the box, and the front cover of the manual aswell as the "title" screen for eSmart 2.0. A later tweet (which can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/XX_750000/status/1459755134615842825">here</a>) explained there is no password lock or opening cutscene like there is in eCDP. Due to the current owner of the eSmart 2.0 cart not wanting to distribute the game files for legal reasons there isnt any further information that can be shared on the food making aspects of the game</h2>
  <h2>The buyer did also release images of the entire eSmart 2.0 manual on twitter (the thread containing them can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/XX_750000/status/1459760817545506817">here</a>) but this doesnt showcase any major game functionalities not found in eCDP</h2>
